    "### Part I: Network Construction (Sections 1-9)\n",
    "1. **Load and Filter Data**: Load goal and user data, filter goals to only those with valid descriptions\n",

    "3. **Show Sample Goals**: Display examples of goals with/without descriptions\n",
    "4. **Prepare Text for Embedding**: Combine title and description for ALL goals\n",
    "5. **Compute Embeddings**: Use sentence transformers to create embeddings (saves to `goal_embeddings.npy` for reuse)\n",
    "6. **Find Similar Goals**: Use cosine similarity threshold (0.9) to group similar goals via Union-Find algorithm\n",
    "7. **Analyze Similar Groups**: Show statistics and examples of all groups found\n",
    "8. **Export Mapping**: Create Excel file with goal-to-representative mappings for validation\n",

    "### Part II: Network and Language Inspection\n",
    "This section can run independently by loading the saved network file:\n",
    "- **Load Network**: Read the filtered network from pickle file\n",
    "- **Inspect Network**: Show connected components statistics\n",
    "- **Language Detection (Section 10)**: Use fastText to detect language of each goal and export to Excel\n",

However, due to the files being too large to store on github, this notebook needs to compute the embeddings all over again if you want to run it. Similarly, for the language detection part, we are using the fastText language detection model, which was downloaded prior, and could also not be stored on github.
